<h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Description'>Module Description</a></h3>

<p>This module will introduce audio software design and programming concepts for digital synthesis, signal processing and control systems. You will first be introduced to electronic music concepts as well as gaining understanding and hands-on experience in modular synthesis with VCV Rack. You will then be introduced to digital systems and computer music: this will include learning the basics about how computation works and the fundamentals of computer programming. We will apply those principles of computer programming with a programming language called SuperCollider. SuperCollider is a powerful language for writing real-time audio processing, synthesis and control systems for music and audio. You will learn the basics of SuperCollider and you will design and build your own software systems for music performance, composition and production that will be demonstrated in practice at a showcasing event. This module therefore provides with various learning objectives that are valuable for your future: 1) it will give you an understanding of electronic and computer music principles, 2) you will start learning how to write computer code, which is a highly sought skill that can be transferable across many professions 3) you will have a better understanding of how computer music software works and how it is built, 4) you will gain practical and theoretical knowledge of sound synthesis and signal processing, 5) you will learn how to make your own software systems for performance, composition and production.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Aims'>Module Aims</a></h3>

<p><strong>Library</strong>: You will be expected to research and write a technical report for this module and this will require finding academic sources (books, journals, etc.) at the library. Online library resources: The library provides a series of online resources that you can access through the library website. You can reach the website by following this <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/library/">link</a>.
<p><a href="http://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/az.php">E-resources</a> include a large collection of useful <a href="http://yorsearch.york.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlSearch.do?&institution=44YORK&azSearch=true&fn=almaAzSearch&query=facet_atoz%2Cexact%2CA">e-journal</a> articles and <a href="http://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/c.php?g=484076&p=3310241">e-books</a> as well as other great music resources including streamable audio and video, electronic scores and databases that you can find by following this <a href="http://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/c.php?g=484041&p=3547049">link.</a>
<p><strong>Software</strong>: For this module, you will need to download two pieces of software: <em>VCV Rack</em> and <em>SuperCollider</em>. They are both open source and free!
<p><strong>VCV Rack</strong>
<p>You can download <em>VCV Rack</em> <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">here</a>.
<p>You should also download and install the third-party plugins, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/wiki/List-of-plugins">here</a>.
<p>The instuctions install the plugins can be found <a href="https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/wiki/Installing-Plugins">here</a>. For Mac, you'll have to go to folder where the application is and press <em>ctr+click</em> on the <strong>Rack</strong> icon - then select <em>Show Package Contents</em>, this will open a folder in the finder. Then go to: <em>Contents-&gt;Resources-&gt;plugins</em>. Then unzip the <em>VCV Rack</em> plugins and drop the unzipped folder contents into the <em>Contents/Resources/plugins</em> folder.
<p>Go to <a href="./../SSfMT/Handbook.html#VCV%20Rack%20and%20Modular%20Links">VCV Rack and Modular Links</a> for free patches and other interesting information.
<p><strong>SuperCollider</strong>
<p>In this module, you'll learn how to work with the SuperCollider programming language. SuperCollider is free and you can download the latest version <a href="http://supercollider.github.io/download">here</a>.
<p>Once you download SuperCollider, you can access the module material by copying and pasting this line of code into a SuperCollider document:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>HelpBrowser.goTo("https://freuben.github.io/york/SSfMT");</pre>

<p>Then, evaluate this code by putting the cursor on the same line and then pressing <em>shift+return</em>. If you don't want to do this every time you want to access the material and want the material to be there when you start SuperCollider, then go to: <em>File-&gt;Open startup file</em> and paste the code there and save the file. Next time you open SuperCollider, the materials will be there!
<p>You should also download and install the <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases">Synthesis Plugins and Extensions</a>.
<p>For quick installation of the plugins in Mac, evaluate each line of code individually in SuperCollider:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>"open https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases/download/Version-3.8.0/sc3-plugins_OSX_SC3.8_692f92f.zip".unixCmd; //download current version of sc-plugins for mac
("open " ++ "~/Downloads/sc3-plugins_OSX_SC3.8_692f92f.zip".standardizePath.shellQuote).unixCmd;
//open zip file
("mv " ++ "~/Downloads/SC3plugins/".standardizePath.shellQuote ++ " " ++ (Platform.userExtensionDir++ "/SC3plugins/").shellQuote).unixCmd; //move the folder to where it belongs</pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, download the <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases">Synthesis Plugins and Extensions</a>, open them and install them in the Extensions folder. You can find out where this folder is by evaluating this code<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Platform.userExtensionDir;</pre>

<p>Move the plugins folder to this directory. If the directory doesn't exist, then create it.
<p>Additionally, you might want to install some third-party packages called <a href="./../Classes/Quarks.html">Quarks</a>.
<p>Go to <a href="./../SSfMT/Handbook.html#SuperCollider%20Links">SuperCollider Links</a> for code examples and other interesting information.
<p><strong>Other software</strong>
