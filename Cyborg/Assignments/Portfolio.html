<p>For your final portfolio of creative and/or technical work (comprising 70% of your mark) you will produce a recorded (audio or video) performance, composition, installation or software demonstration with the various software and programming tools examined in this module (SuperCollider, Wekinator, Magenta Studio, etc.). You can also use other software (DAWs, plugins, etc.) or hardware (mics, synths, studio gear, etc.) as long as you use them in combination with the software and programming tools examined in this module. The recording can be divided into shorter pieces of work (songs, movements, episodes) or can be a single longer piece of work. If you chose to only do technical work, the recording should demonstrate how your software or system works. You can work individually or in a group of 2 - the audio or video recording will last a minimum of 9 minutes if you work alone or 18 minutes if you work with someone else. If you chose to work with someone else, each member of the group will have to present their work individually (develop separate code, workflows and individual portfolio documentation). You will be responsible not only for your own work, but for making sure that the collaboration is successful.
<p>The work presented will consist of a creative and/or technical project that will use the software and programming tools examined in this module applied to your own creative or professional practice. You should demonstrate through your work that you have responded to the module theme of human-machine co-creativity, as well as understand key concepts in computation, creativity and computer music, including topics such as computer-aided composition, algorithmic music, machine listening and learning, automatic music generation, and/or human-machine interaction.
<p>Your project will need to be negotiated with your module leader before it is approved.
<p>You will hand-in your work online via the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/services/deposit/">Deposit Service</a>. This will include a ZIP file containing a <em>pdf</em> of the <a href="./../../Cyborg/Assignments/Portfolio Documentation.html">Portfolio Documentation</a> and all supporting materials (code, files, etc.) you used for your portfolio. Make sure you read all information about <a href="./../../Cyborg/Handbook.html#Assessment">Assessment</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1_RlB8FwJqjPXdrbxcEF2crJFd_hAqA2030Lm-_mh0/edit?usp=sharing">Submission</a> before uploading your work.
<p><strong>Summary</strong><ul>
<li>Create a portfolio of creative and/or technical work presented as an audio or video recording of a performance, composition, installation or software demonstration produced with the various software and programming tools examined in this module (SuperCollider, Wekinator, Magenta Studio, etc.) as well as other software (DAWs, plugins).<li>You will work individually or in groups of 2 to create a recording of a minimum of 9 minutes per person. If you work with someone, you will have to present independent outputs (portfolio documentation, code, etc.) and your work will be assessed separately.<li>Your portfolio will demonstrate a good understanding of key concepts in computation, creativity and computer music in relation to the theme of human-machine co-creativity.<li>Through your portfolio you will show knowledge of topics including computer-aided composition, algorithmic music, machine listening and learning, automatic music generation, and/or human-machine interaction.<li>Hand-in portfolio (recording), portfolio documentation (pdf) and supporting materials (code, files, etc.) through the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/services/deposit/">Deposit Service</a>.</ul>
