<p>Your Portfolio Documentation will be a 1500-word piece of writing explaining the research and reasoning behind your <a href="./../../Cyborg/Assignments/Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> as it relates to human-machine co-creativity and the module themes. This piece of writing should include the things that you have done and considered, including a critical reflection on your work, with well-developed arguments grounded on research using reliable academic sources. It should be a serious piece of writing addressing creative, theoretical, technical and contextual issues explaining your project (it should not only be a list of things that you've done). If you are working in groups, it is crucial that your documentation focuses on your unique contribution and on your own code.
<p>In your technical report, you should seek to:<ul>
<li>Explain the initial concept/idea for the project.<li>Show evidence of the research you have done for the project.<li>Explain the creative (musical, artistic and aesthetic), technical and research processes and aims.<li>If you work in a group, demonstrate that your collaboration with the other members in your group was successful.<li>Present your portfolio documentation in an organised way and write clearly with use of standard academic language.<li>Exhibit a fair amount of critical thinking about your project and that you critically evaluated the creative, technaical and/or research outputs (what are the conclusions?)</ul>

<p>The work that you submit should include:<ol>
<li>1500 word piece of writing. In your portfolio documentation you should credit all of the people that were involved in the project (any collaborators), as well as any samples of code, software, music or sounds by other people that you used in your project.<li>A ZIP file containing the following:<ul>
<li><a href="./../../Cyborg/Assignments/Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a><li>PDF of the portfolio documentation.<li>Supporting materials, such as code, files, external libraries, etc. (it's not necessary to include DAW projects).</ul>
</ol>

<p>You will hand-in your work online via the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/services/deposit/">Deposit Service</a>.
