<p>In this module, you will be introduced to concepts in computation, creativity and computer music in relation to human-machine co-creativity. For this formative assessment, you will prepare and give a seminar presentation of 15 minutes. During this presentation, you will play a short track that you will produce using the various software and programming tools examined in this module (SuperCollider, Wekinator, Magenta Studio, etc.). You can work individually or in groups of two. The track can be in any genre of music you like and should be 3-5 minutes long - if you work in pairs, you can produce either 2 x 3-5 min long tracks or 1 x 6-10 min track and a group presentation of 30 minutes. You can also use other software (DAWs, plugins, etc.) or hardware (mics, synths, studio gear, etc.) as long as you use them in combination with the software and programming tools examined in this module. You can also use recordings of vocals or other instruments in combination with the outputs of these tools (you can edit, process and combine them as you wish). In your presentation, you will explain what concepts inspired the work and the techniques you have used to produce the track. You will also show and explain the code and processes you wrote, used or repurposed for this assignment. It is important that you explain these concepts clearly using the information given to you during class and through the readings. You are encouraged to use audio/visual materials and slides during your presentation. Finally, prepare to answer a few questions from your classmates at the end of your seminar.
<p><strong>Summary</strong><ul>
<li>Prepare and give a seminar presentation of 15 minutes (30 min for group presentations).<li>Produce a 3-5 minutes (or twice that lengh if you work in pairs) track using the software and programming tools examined in this module (SuperCollider, Wekinator, Magenta, etc.) as well as other software/hardware of your choice.<li>Explain the computation, creativity and computer music concepts you explored to produce the track and their relationship to human-machine co-creativity.<li>Explain the technologies and techniques used to produce the output.<li>Show your SuperCollider code, patches and any other relevant files or software.<li>Prepare to answer questions.</ul>
