<h2><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Overview'>Module Overview</a></h2>
<h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Description'>Module Description</a></h3>

<p>Creativity is an activity that is often regarded as unique to humans. However, once the nature of creativity is interrogated, it is possible to suggest that some of its characteristics are not exclusive to humans and can be found elsewhere in nature. Some processes that are usually associated with creativity, can even be rationalised and broken down into actions that machines can perform. As computers become more powerful, machines are getting better at producing convincing outputs that seem to have creative qualities. This opens up possibilities to collaborate and co-create music with machines.
<p>In this module, we will examine different theories that attempt to explain creativity, including its nature, the conditions by which it can take place, and the various types of creative processes that can be identified and modelled. Crucially, we will focus on musical creativity and how humans and machines can create music together. This includes different approaches to human-machine collaboration in composition, performance, music production and sound art. We will examine themes including computer-aided composition, algorithmic music, machine listening and learning, automatic music generation, and human-machine interaction. While exploring these themes, we will critically interrogate what are the particularly useful forms of collaboration and unique artistic features that can emerge through human-machine co-creation. This will include a careful consideration of human- and machine- like qualities in both humans and machines, and how these in turn can be merged and synthesised into an integrated and productive creative flow.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Aims'>Module Aims</a></h3>

<p>This module aims to:<ul>
<li>provide an introduction to human-machine co-creativity, including theoretical, historical, critical and technical aspects of computation, creativity, computer music, and creative applications of technology.<li>describe and explain different approaches to human-machine collaboration in music, including computer-aided composition, algorithmic music, machine listening and learning, automatic music generation, and human-machine interaction.<li>introduce software programming and computer music concepts and their application in creative coding.</ul>

<p><h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Outcomes'>Module Outcomes</a></h3>

<p>By the end of the taught part of the project all students should:<ul>
<li>understand basic theoretical, historical, critical and technical aspects of computation, creativity and computer music and their relationship to human-machine co-creativity.<li>have the ability to apply human-machine co-creativity concepts in creative and technical projects.<li>have basic programming skills including using, writing and repurposing code.</ul>
<h3><a class='anchor' name='Prerequisites'>Prerequisites</a></h3>

<p>Students should have basic computer literacy and own or have access to a computer, be willing to engage with numerical and conceptual approaches to music and creativity, and be prepared to use technology and do basic computer programming.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Flipped%20classroom'>Flipped classroom</a></h3>

<p>This module uses the blended learning approach of <strong>flipped classroom</strong> for the <em>practicals</em>. This means you will go through <a href="./../Cyborg.html#Practicals">coding tutorials</a> by yourself at home and in the classroom, we will work on practical coding exercises and group activities to review, internalise and practice the skills and information you gain from the tutorials. It is therefore important that you complete the coding tutorials in preparation for the practicals before each session. If you don't, you will not be able to participate in the practicals and will not take advantage of the hands-on approach of these sessions.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Attendance'>Attendance</a></h3>

<p>Attendance to all of the seminars, practicals and tutorials is mandatory. Attendance will be monitored for each of these sessions. You are expected to be on time to all sessions.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Communication'>Communication</a></h3>

<p>Please check your university email regularly as this will be the primary form of communication between staff and students. Also, check the module materials regularly to access seminar slides, coding tutorials and exercises, information about deadlines, assignment briefs, reading materials, etc. Before contacting staff members about information, check the module handbook first as most of the module information will be available to you there.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Independent%20study'>Independent study</a></h3>

<p>According to university regulations, the amount of time you should devote to private study for this module is a total of 109 hours, that is at least 8 hours per week outside your assessment preparation. Therefore, during this time you should be engaging with reading material, coding tutorials, practicing programming skills, researching on related topics, experimenting with technology and code, etc. This of course does not include your time in seminars, workshops and tutorials. In addition to this, you will be expected to spend at least 60 hours for assessment preparation to prepare your presentation, portfolio and portfolio documentation. This is the very minimum amount of time of independent study expected from you to pass this module.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Module%20Plan'>Module Plan</a></h3>

<p>The assessment criteria specific to this module will be considered and used as a measure to determine your achievement in the summative assessment process at the end of the module. <em>Seminars</em> will provide the opportunity to gain new knowledge in theoretical, historical, critical and technical aspects of computation, creativity, computer music, and creative applications of technology. <em>Practicals</em> will give you hands-on experience in basic coding, synthesis and digital audio, scheduling and control structures, human-computer interfacing and music generation and the opportunity to creatively experiment with computers. <em>Formative assessment</em> and <em>tasks</em> will occur during seminars and practicals as well as through the <a href="./../Cyborg.html#Practicals">coding tutorials</a> and independent learning. These tasks and exercises will guide you through the learning process, ensuring you have the necessary knowledge and skills to complete the summative assessments. <em>Summative assessments</em> will be used to evaluate your performance in relation to module and programme outcomes. The <em>Portfolio</em> of creative and/or technical work will provide the opportunity to demonstrate creative thinking and technical skills and your involvement with challenging problem solving, creative processes and research activities. The <em>Portfolio documentation</em> provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your level of knowledge and understanding of relevant creative, theoretical, and technical concepts, debates and contexts and to present this information clearly. The <em>presentation</em> will allow you to showcase and explain your work-in progress, to demonstrate your creative and technical ideas and to display your presentation skills.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Assessment%20Deadlines'>Assessment Deadlines</a></h3>

<h3><a class='anchor' name='Resources'>Resources</a></h3>

<p><strong>Library</strong>: You will be expected to research and write a portfolio documentation for this module and this will require finding academic sources (books, journals, etc.) at the library. Online library resources: The library provides a series of online resources that you can access through the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/library/">library website</a>.
<p>E-resources include a large collection of useful e-journal articles and e-books as well as other great music resources including streamable audio and video, electronic scores and databases that you can find <a href="http://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/c.php?g=484041&p=3547049">here</a>.
<p><strong>Software</strong>: For this module, you will engage with a variety of software, including SuperCollider, Wekinator, Magenta Demos and other music and audio software.
<p><strong>SuperCollider</strong>
<p>In this module, you'll learn how to work with the SuperCollider programming language. SuperCollider is free and you can download the latest version <a href="http://supercollider.github.io/download">here</a>.
<p>Once you download SuperCollider, you can access the module material by copying and pasting this line of code into a SuperCollider document:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>HelpBrowser.goTo("https://freuben.github.io/york/Cyborg");</pre>

<p>Then, evaluate this code by putting the cursor on the same line and then pressing <em>shift+return</em>. If you don't want to do this every time you want to access the material and want the material to be there when you start SuperCollider, then go to: <em>File-&gt;Open startup file</em> and paste the code there and save the file. Next time you open SuperCollider, the materials will be there!
<p>You should also download and install the <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases">Synthesis Plugins and Extensions</a>.
<p>For quick installation of the plugins in Mac, evaluate each line of code individually in SuperCollider:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>"open https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/releases/download/Version-3.8.0/sc3-plugins_OSX_SC3.8_692f92f.zip".unixCmd; //download current version of sc-plugins for mac
("open " ++ "~/Downloads/sc3-plugins_OSX_SC3.8_692f92f.zip".standardizePath.shellQuote).unixCmd;
//open zip file
("mv " ++ "~/Downloads/SC3plugins/".standardizePath.shellQuote ++ " " ++ (Platform.userExtensionDir++ "/SC3plugins/").shellQuote).unixCmd; //move the folder to where it belongs</pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, download the Synthesis Plugins and Extensions, open them and install them in the Extensions folder. You can find out where this folder is by evaluating this code<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Platform.userExtensionDir;</pre>

<p>Move the plugins folder to this directory. If the directory doesn't exist, then create it.
<p>Additionally, you might want to install some third-party packages called <a href="./../Classes/Quarks.html">Quarks</a>.
<p>Go to <a href="./../Cyborg/Handbook.html#SuperCollider%20Links">SuperCollider Links</a> for code examples and other interesting information.
